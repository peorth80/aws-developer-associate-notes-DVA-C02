# ELB: Elastic Load Balancers

Load balancers are servers that forward internet traffic to multiple servers (EC2 Instances) downstream

#### Why use a load balancer?
* Spread load across multiple downstream instances
* Expose a single point of access (DNS) to your application
* Seamlessly handle failures of downstream instances
* Do regular health checks to your instances
* Provide SSL termination (HTTPS) for your websites
* Enforce stickiness with cookies
* High availability across zones
* Separate public traffic from private traffic

#### AN ELB (EC2 Load Balancer) is a managed load balancer
* AWS guarantees that it will be working
* AWS takes care of upgrades, maintenance, high availability
* AWS provides only a few configuration knobs

It costs less to setup your own load balancer, but it will be a lot more effort on your end. It is integrated with many AWS offerings / services

#### Types of load balancers on AWS
* Classic Load Balancer (v1 - older generation - 2009)
* Application Load Balancer (v2 - new generation - 2016)
* Network Load Balancer (v2 - new generation - 2017)
* You can setup internal or external ELBs

#### Health Checks
* Health checks are crucial for load balancers
* They enable the load balancer to know if instances it forwards traffic to are available to reply to requests
* The health check is done on a port and a route (/health is common)
* If the response is not 200 (OK), then the instance is unhealthy

#### Application Load Balancer (v2)
* Application load balancers (Layer 7) allow to do:
  * Load balancing to multiple HTTP applications across machines (target groups)
  * Load balancing to multiple applications on the same machine (ex: containers)
  * Load balancing based on route in URL
  * Load balancing based on hostname in URL 
* Basically, they’re awesome for micro services & container-based application (example: Docker & Amazon ECS) 
* Has a port mapping feature to redirect to a dynamic port 
* In comparison, we would need to create one Classic Load Balancer per application before. That was very expensive and inefficient!
* Good to Know
    * Stickiness can be enabled at the target group level
        * Same request goes to the same instance
        * Stickiness is directly generated by the ALB (NOT the application)
    * ALB supports HTTP/HTTPS & Web sockets protocols
    * The application servers don’t see the IP of the client directly
        * The true IP of the client is inserted in the header X-Forwarded-For
        * We can also get Port (X-Forwarded-Port) and protocol (X-Forwarded-Proto)
#### Network Load Balancer (v2)
* Layer 4 allow you to do:
    * Forward TCP traffic to your instances
    * Handle millions of requests per second
    * Support for static IP or elastic IP
    * Less latency ~100ms (vs 400 ms for ALB)
* Network Load Balancers are mostly used for extreme performance and should not be the default load balancer you choose
* Overall, the creation process is the same as the Application Load Balancer

#### Load Balancers Good to Know
* Any Load Balancer (CLB, ALB, NLB) has a static host name. They do not resolve and use underlying IP
* LBs can scale but not instantaneously - contact AWS for a “warm up”
* NLB directly see the client IP
* 4xx errors are client induced errors
* 5xx errors are application induced errors
    * Load balancer Errors 503 means at capacity or no registered target
* If the LB can’t connect to your application, check your security groups
